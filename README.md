# Cloud SOC & Honeynet Implementation in Azure (Live Traffic)

## Overview

This project involves creating a small-scale honeynet within Azure, designed to attract and monitor potential cyber threats by collecting diverse log data.  These logs are funneled into a Log Analytics workspace, where Microsoft Sentinel processes them to map attack patterns, issue alerts, and log incidents.  Initially, I recorded key security metrics in an unprotected setup over a 24-hour period.  After enhancing security measures to fortify the environment, I conducted another 24-hour assessment to compare metrics pre- and post-hardening.  The findings are summarized below, highlighting metrics such as:

- **SecurityEvent**:  Logs from Windows system events
- **Syslog**:  Logs from Linux system events
- **SecurityAlert**:  Alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud and other Azure security solutions
- **SecurityIncident**:  Incidents documented by Microsoft Sentinel
- **AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL**:  Network flow logs from Network Security Groups (NSGs)

## Azure Infrastructure Components:

- Virtual Machines (2 Windows 10 Pro, 1 Linux Ubuntu 22)
- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Groups (2 NSGs)
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources are deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet; aka, no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-03-15 17:04:29
Stop Time 2023-03-16 17:04:29

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 19470
| Syslog                   | 3028
| SecurityAlert            | 10
| SecurityIncident         | 348
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 843

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-03-18 15:37
Stop Time	2023-03-19 15:37

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8778
| Syslog                   | 25
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastically reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
